### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
Refactoring a code has several advantages. One advantage of refactoring a code is that it can be simpler. This will allow it to be more readable and easier to repurpose for other tasks. Another benefit of refactoring code is to make it more efficient so it runs quicker on a computer. In this task that was not very important, but for more complicated codes this is a must. A disadvantage is the significant time it can take it can take.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code for this Assignment
The refactored code was not easier to understand. It ran faster but the old code ran very fast so this was not very signfiicant. It took me a long time to refactor the code. So the time disadvantage was significant.
