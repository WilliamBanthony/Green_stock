# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to assist my good friend, Steve, in his goal to diversify his parents' investments in green energy stocks. This analysis was conducted by using VBA scripts in conjunction with data Steve provided in an excel spreadsheet. 

## Results

### Stock Performance

The stocks in 2017 all showed growth except for TERP which lost 7.2% of it's value. 2018 was not a good year in general for Green energy stocks. ENPH and RUN showed huge growth but every other stock showed a loss. Steve should be careful investing in the voliatile stocks.

### The Code
The refactored code ran faster as you can see between the original code time here:

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
Refactoring a code has several advantages. One advantage of refactoring a code is that it can be simpler. This will allow it to be more readable and easier to repurpose for other tasks. Another benefit of refactoring code is to make it more efficient so it runs quicker on a computer. In this task that was not very important, but for more complicated codes this is a must. A disadvantage is the significant time it can take it can take.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code for this Assignment
The refactored code was not easier to understand. It ran faster but the old code ran very fast so this was not very signfiicant. It took me a long time to refactor the code. So the time disadvantage was significant.
